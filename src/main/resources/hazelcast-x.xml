            The preferred port number where the Hazelcast instance will listen. The convention is
            to use 5701 and it is the default both here and in various tools connecting to
            Hazelcast. This configuration has the following attributes:
            - port-count:
                The default value is 100, meaning that Hazelcast will try to bind 100 ports.
                If you set the value of port as 5701, as members join the cluster, Hazelcast tries
                to find ports between 5701 and 5801. You can change the port count in cases like
                having large instances on a single machine or you are willing to have only a few
                ports assigned.
            - auto-increment:
                Default value is true. If port is set to 5701, Hazelcast will try to find free
                ports between 5701 and 5801. Normally, you will not need to change this value, but
                it comes in handy when needed. You may also want to choose to use only one port.
                In that case, you can disable the auto-increment feature of port by setting its
                value as false.

        <!--
            This configuration lets you choose a discovery mechanism that Hazelcast will use to
            form a cluster. Hazelcast can find members by multicast, TCP/IP lists and by various
            discovery mechanisms provided by different cloud APIs.
